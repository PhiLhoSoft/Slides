# JavaScript:<br/>an unloved<br/>language
</script></section>

				<section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## History

Created in 1995 by Brendan Eich working at Netscape, at the time leader of innovation in the browser domain.

Made for small scripts to run in the browser, like form validation or on click action.

Should have been named LiveScript but popularity of the rising Java led to JavaScript (two capitals!) for marketing purpose.

That, and superficial similarity with Java syntax lead to confusion where people think that one is an abbreviation of the other!
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Presentation

Normalised as ECMAScript, ECMA-262.

Syntax is similar to Java (C-like), but semantic (functions) is close of Lisp / Scheme, prototypal inheritance comes from Self and regular expressions from Perl.

Dynamically and weakly typed. Type of variables isn't declared and we can assign them values of varying type.

Object-oriented but not based on classes, based on prototypes.

Functions are first-class citizens.

Not limited to the browser: Java has a built-in interpreter, Node.js is a server-side Web framework, etc.
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Why no love?

Mostly from users coming from Java or C#, not using idiosyncrasies of JS.

![JavaScript: the Good Parts vs. JavaScript: the Definitive Guide](JS-TheGoodParts.jpg "JavaScript: the Good Parts vs. JavaScript: the Definitive Guide")

Douglas Crockford, author of _JavaScript: the Good Parts_, an excellent book (inspiration for these slides) calls JavaScript "_the world's most misunderstood programming language_".
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### No love, because...

Dynamic typing implies runtime errors instead of compilation errors. And poor tooling.

No classes, prototype inheritance not known nor understood.

Language has weaknesses, pitfalls and dark sides.

<br/>
##### Things of the past

Browser implementations were unequal, and inconsistent.

JavaScript speed was awful. It is much improved now.
</script></section>

				</section>

				<section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Types

Variables are not typed, values are (but can have implicit conversions).

Numbers are 64-bit floating point values. No true integers.

Strings are made of 16-bit Unicode characters. No char type. Delimited by `"` or `'`. `\` escape, `\uHHHH` notation. Immutables. Concatenation with `+`, comparison with `==`.

Boolean type but lot of values are implicitly `false` (`0`, `""`, `null`, `undefined`, `NaN`), all others are `true`.

`null` and `undefined` are types with only one possible value.

Objects are everything else...
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Statements

Variables can be used without being declared and are then global!

The `var` statement defines a private variable whose scope is the current function.

The soft braces `{ }` don't define a scope!

Classical conditional, looping and disruptive statements (`break`, `continue`, `return`, throwing exceptions).
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### break and continue

They allow to exit of the loop where they are used. (`break` is also used in the `switch` statement.)<br/>
Both can take an optional label.
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### return

If not explicit, a function returns `undefined`. If a function is invoked as a constructor, the implicit return value is `this`, the constructed object.

Beware: JavaScript attempts to infer semi-colons from end-of-line, so

    return
    {
      value: 5
    };

is seen by JS as a single `return` statement (returning `undefined`) followed by an object declaration!

Here, you have to write:

    return {
      value: 5
    };
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Exceptions

Can be thrown and caught. Can be any object.

    if (bad) throw { errorCode: 405, message: "You goofed!" }
    try
    {
      canThrow();
    }
    catch (e)
    {
      alert("Oops: " + e);
    }
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Expressions

An expression statement can assign a value to one or more variables, can call a function or can delete a property from an object.
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Operators

JavaScript has the classical Java operators, including bitwise ones (coercing numbers to integers).

The `typeof` operator produces a string: one of 'number', 'string', 'boolean', 'undefined', 'function' and 'object'.

Invocation `()` executes a function, optionally with parameters.

Refinement `[]` specifies a property or element of an object or array.
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Coercion

JavaScript goes out of its way to force a value to be of the desired type. If you want a boolean, it can convert strings or numbers to `true` or `false`. `"5"` can be treated as `5` automatically, and so on.

So a conditional like `a == b` can lead to surprises. That's why most programmers only use the `===` operator which always return `false` when each side is of different type. `"5" == 5` is `true`, but `"5" === 5` is `false`.
</script></section>

				</section>

				<section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Objects

`Object` is the only mutable type. Objects are keyed collections, containers of properties, ie. name and value pairs.

Arrays, functions and regular expressions are objects.

A property name can be any string.
A property value can be any value, except `undefined`.

So called global variables are actually properties of the global object, named `window` in a browser.
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Object literals

An object literal is made of curly braces around a comma-separated list of name-value pairs (pair separated by a colon).

    var empty = {}
    var somebody = { "given name": "Arthur", name: "Rambo", age: 27,
      'skin color': { r: 102, g: 55, b: 27 } };

Quotes around the name can be omitted if the name is a valid identifier (not a keyword).

A value can be another object literal, literal declarations can be nested.
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Retrieval

To get the value of a property, use the notation `o.propertyName` if the name is a legal identifier, or `o['property name']` in all cases.

Return value is `undefined` if the name is unknown. Retrieving a value from `undefined` throws a TypeError exception.

    // Get value with default
    var speed = ennemy.speed || 0;
    // Guard against TypeError
    var posX = enemy.coordinates && enemy.coordinates.x;
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Update

Just assign the value. If the property doesn't exist, it is created.

Objects are passed around by reference, not by copy.
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Prototype

Every object is linked to a prototype object from which it inherits properties. By default they inherit from `Object.prototype`, built in JavaScript.
When we try to retrieve a property value from an object and it is not found, JavaScript looks in the prototype object. It goes up in the chain until it finds the property, up to `Object.prototype`. If not found, the result is undefined. That's delegation.

A new property in a prototype is immediately visible in all objects based on that prototype.
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Reflection

`typeof`  operator allows to find out the type of a property.

`hasOwnProperty` method tells if a property is defined in the object itself or is inherited.
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Enumeration and deletion

`for in` loop enumerates properties from the whole inheritance chain.

`delete` allows to remove a property from an object:<br/>
`delete foo.obsolete;`
</script></section>

				</section>

				<section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Functions

Functions are objects, inheriting from the `Function` prototype, itself linked to the `Object` prototype.

They can be stored in variables, arrays and object properties, passed as parameters or returned from functions.

They can have properties and methods. That's actually a way to create objects with private members.
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Literal

    var a = function (x, y)  // Anonymous function
    {
      return x * y;
    }
    var r = function recursive(z)
    {
      if (z < 2) return 1;
      return z * recursive(z - 1);
    }
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Closure

A function created inside another can access the variables and parameters of the parent function.

It has a link to that outer context.

That's a _closure_.

The closure, function linked to a context, can survive the outer function.

    function giveF(a) // a is fixed when giveF() is called
    {
      var x = Date.now(); // x is frozen at the time of call of giveF()
      return function (z)
      {
        return z + ' ' + a + ' ' + x;
      }
    }
    var f = giveF(5);
    // giveF() is finished, but its parameters a and x still live in f
    ShowResult(f(7)); // => 7 5 1401402052818
    ShowResult(f(17)); // => 17 5 1401402052818
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Invocation

A function is invoked by passing values to its parameters, if any.

    <expression with a function value>(...)

It also has two additional implicit parameters: `this` and `arguments`.

If there are less parameters in the invocation than in the declaration, the last parameters get the `undefined` value.

If there are more parameters, extra parameters are ignored but are present in the `arguments` (pseudo-)array. This allows to make functions with variable number of arguments.
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Invocation patterns

JavaScript has four patterns to invoke functions. They change the value of `this` in the function.
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
#### Method invocation pattern

When the property of an object has a function value, it is a method of that object.

When this method is called, `this` in this method is bound to the object.

Functions that get their object context from `this` are called _public methods_.
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
#### Function invocation pattern

When a function is not the property of an object, it is invoked as a function. `this` is bound to the global object.

Thus, if a method declares an inner function, that inner function cannot access the `this` of the enclosing function, ie. the context of the enclosing object.

A workaround is to assign the enclosing function's `this` to a variable (traditionally called `that`). Thus the inner function can access it as a closure.

    var o = {
      data: { x: 10, y: 20 },
      outer: function ()
      {
        var that = this;
        doStuff('foo', function (result) { display(that.data.x * result.factor); });
      }
    }
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
#### Constructor invocation pattern

If a function is invoked with the `new` prefix, a new object is created.

The object is linked to the function's prototype, and `this` is bound to the new object.

General convention is to capitalize the name of these functions, to make them to look like classes.

This style of function is actually rarely used.
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
#### Apply invocation pattern

The `apply` method takes two parameters: the object to bind to `this`, and an array of parameters.

    var r = someMethod.apply(someObject, [p1, p2]);

Example:

    var bla = function (x, y)
    {
      alert(this.a + x + y);
    }
    bla.apply({ a: "msg - " }, [ 'this is x', ' and y' ]); // => Show "msg - this is x and y"
</script></section>

				</section>

				<section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Arrays

In JavaScript, arrays are not classical arrays, ie. memory chunks that can be addressed by an index.

They are actually associative arrays, where numerical indexes are still properties.
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Literal

    var a = [ 'a', 'b', 'c' ];

is equivalent to the declaration:

    var a = { '0': 'a', '1': 'b', '2': 'c' };

but actually the array inherits from `Array.prototype` and so has useful methods and the special `length` property.
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Dynamic

We can put values of different types in an array:

    var a = [ 'a', true, { 'o': 42 }, [ 5 ] ];

Arrays are dynamic: if we assign a value to a non-existing index, the length of the array is adjusted to this index.

    var a = [];
    a[5] = 'k'; // a.length == 6
    a[a.length] = 'new'; // Append to end
    a.push('another'); // Idem

If we assign a value to `length` smaller than its current value, the array is truncated, excess values are deleted.
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Deletion

    delete a[5];

assigns `undefined` to the 6th entry of the array.

    a.splice(5, 1);

removes 1 entry of the array at position 5, shifting down the other entries.
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Tidbits

Arrays can hold other arrays, that's the way to make multi-dimension arrays.

Avoid to use `for in` iteration over arrays: the order is not guaranted!

Do not mix arrays (mostly used with small integer indices) and objects (used as associative arrays, aka. hash maps).

You can add methods to arrays.
</script></section>

				</section>

				<section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Regular expressions

JavaScript has a native support for Perl-like regular expressions, with a literal annotation:

    // Testing for a match
    var idMatcher = /^[a-z_]\w*$/i;
    var ok = idMatcher.test("FooBar"); // => true

    // Applying a regexp, with captures, resulting in an array
    var propMatcher = /^(\w+)\s*=\s*(.+)$/;
    var pair = propMatcher.exec("alpha = beta"); // => [ 'alpha = beta', 'alpha', 'beta' ]
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Construction

Either via the literal (expression between slashes optionally followed by modifiers) or via the RegExp constructor.

    var propMatcher = new RegExp("^(\\w+)\\s*=\\s*(.+)$"); // Must double \

Modifiers are:

- i = case insensitive
- g = global, can match several times
- m = multiline: ^ and $ can match line-ending characters.
</script></section>

				</section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Idioms
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Augmenting types

JavaScript allows to add methods and properties to an existing type, even built-in like String or Array.

To use with care, because of potential conflicts between libraries.

    String.prototype.doubler = function () { var v = this; return v.concat(v); }
    var yoyo = 'yo'.doubler();
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Recursion

JavaScript allows recursion but doesn't has tail recursion optimization,
when the function returns the result of invoking itself.

So, beware of stack size!
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Scope

As seen, JavaScript have function scope, and a variable can be used before being declared.

As a convention, to avoid confusion, general practice is to declare all variables at the top of a function.
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Module

JavaScript doesn't have private visibility, but variables defined in a function are not visible from outside. Using closures, we can expose accessors, not the variables themselves.

    var person = function (n, a)
    {
      var name = n, age = a;
      return {
        setAge: function (a) { age = a; },
        setName: function (n) { name = n; },
        getAge: function () { return age; },
        getName: function () { return name; }
      }
    }
    var p = person("James", 31);
    alert(p.getName() + ", " + p.getAge()); // Cannot access p.name
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Cascade

An idiom practiced in many languages (some support it naturally) is to chain calls on an object.

    stuff.normalize().sort().filter(predicate);

In JS, the trick is to make each method to return `this` instead of `undefined`, even for setters.
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Object specifier

JavaScript doesn't have named parameters but we can pass an object as parameter instead of lot of unamed parameters:

    var newObject = builder({ x: 5, y: 11, r: 3.14 });

Meaning is more explicit, order is not important and default values can be handled.
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Curry

Currying allows to to produce a new function by combining a partial function and a value.

It is a common idiom in functional programming. Example:

    var prefixer = function (prefix)
    {
      return function (name)
      {
        return prefix + name;
      }
    }

    var httpPrefixer = prefixer('http://');
    httpPrefixer("google.com"); // => http://google.com
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Memoization

Another idiom from the functional programming realm.

Here, a function can store in a cache the previous results it produced. Thus, when it is called with parameters it already processed, it just returns the previous result.

For example a function producing Fibonacci numbers can use previous results to avoid computing the series from 1 each time.
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## JavaScript memory leaks

JS is a garbage collected language, creating objects, keeping track of them, and removing them when they are no longer referenced.

But circular references can make some objects to be never released in some browser, particularly those using reference counting to handle memory for DOM objects.
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Circular reference

    var elt;
    window.onload = function()
    {
      elt = document.getElementById("SomeElement");
      // Search again, add a new property to this element
      document.getElementById("SomeElement").newProperty = elt
      elt.lotOfMemory = new Array(1000).join(new Array(100).join("X--X"));
    };

`elt` has a reference on the `SomeElement` Dom object, which in turn has a reference to this object, via the `newProperty`.
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Another circular reference

    // Object constructor
    function AddProperty(element)
    {
      this.elementReference = element;
      // Creates a circular reference here by Dom -> JS -> Dom references
      element.newProperty = this;
    }
    function doLeak()
    {
      // Leak
      return new AddProperty(document.getElementById("SomeElement"));
    }
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Circular reference with closure

    window.onload = function outer()
    {
      var elt = document.getElementById("SomeElement");
      elt.onclick = function inner()
      {
        alert("You are creating a memory leak!");
      };
      // Show leak can be significant!
      elt.lotOfMemory = new Array(1000).join(new Array(100).join("X--X"));
    };

Common pitfall when handling events in JS.
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Avoiding memory leaks

- Add a way to set the big object to `null` after usage, thus cutting the circular reference.
- Wrap the object declaration in a closure.

      window.onload = function outer()
      {
        var inner = function () { alert("You avoided the leak"); };
        (function ()
        {
          // elt will be collectable at the end of the scope generated by the function
          var elt =  document.getElementById("SomeElement");
          elt.onclick = doAction;
        })(); // Immediate call
      };

- Or avoid making a closure.

      window.onload = function ()
      {
        var elt = document.getElementById("SomeElement");
        elt.onclick = doesNotLeak;
      }
      function doesNotLeak() { alert("No leak at all"); }
</script></section>

## The JavaScript ecosystem

JavaScript is mostly used in browsers, which offer an interesting (portable and graphically rich) platform for developping applications with user interface.
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Libraries

Lot of libraries and frameworks have been developped in JavaScript. Some of them were initially designed to address the browser quirks and differences. Lot of them exploit the new HTML 5 features, providing rich user experience in the browser.

#### jQuery

jQuery is a all-purpose library with a plugin feature that generated a flurry of varied extensions. It became rather pervasive in Web development, despite having concurrents like Prototype or ExtJS.
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Other languages

A current trend in programming languages is to make compilers to produce JavaScript code instead of native code, C code or byte code (JVM or CLR).

This allows them to improve their portability, from desktop to mobile phones, and to ease their deployment.

This goes from CoffeeScript (inspired by Ruby and Python) to Dart (specifically designed for this purpose), including Java (GWT), Ceylon and Microsoft's TypeScript.

The main purpose is to hide the JS quirks and, often, to offer a static type system to the programmers, with better tools.
</script></section>

				</section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Conclusion

Despite its quirks, JavaScript is one of the most used programming language.

One reason is that it is easy to use for simple code (but it is easy to write bad code!).

But the main reason is that it is pervasive and unavoidable: it is the only language available in nearly all Web browsers.

So anybody have a JavaScript interpreter at hand and it is the mandatory gate to write code in a Web browser.

That's why so many languages "compile" ("transpile" or "transcompile", actually) to JavaScript code.

The language has issues, but if coders restrict themselves to a strict subset of the language, using some coding discipline, JS is a pleasant language to code in.
