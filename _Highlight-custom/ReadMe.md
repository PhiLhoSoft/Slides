This directory has Reveal themes that I changed to give a personalized look to my slides.

- sky.css is the Sky theme with personal tweaks.
- github.css is a highlight.js theme (based on GitHub's syntax highlighting) with tweaks, too.
- highlight.js is the latest (2015-10-06) version of Highlight where I added the Reveal's customization header.<br>
It doesn't integrate the syntax highlighting scripts, I took them from the site, adding the hljs.registerLanguage() call to wrap them.<br>
This allows to pick up the syntax highlighting I need for each presentation.
